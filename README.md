This is my first website that was created as part of the Round-3 of Task Round for ECHOES.
The website is a Halloween themed invitation, registration portal.
It also has links to my socials, with app icons that directly allows you to go there.
The website only has a front end to it, developed using HTML and CSS.
Thanks!!
